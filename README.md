SIGApp is an independent student project for academic purposes. It has most of the functions of the SIGA website. However, it lacks features like:

- Course registration
- Class Schedule Report
- Report of Course Report
- Study Plan Report
- Verification of Courses
- Academic History Report

The app loads the student's user data from the SIGA website of the National University of Piura. Its way of operating is through web scraping, so it totally depends on the web [http://academico.unp.edu.pe/](http://academico.unp.edu.pe/).
